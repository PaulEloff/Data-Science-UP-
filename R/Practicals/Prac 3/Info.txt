Practical 3 format
With this practical, we are changing the handout and submission format.

Handout:

The questions are captured in two formats: html and .rmd (R markdown).
The html format is a flat file which reads like a normal document.
It doesn't contain any links. The rmd format is an R markdown file can be opened in R Studio.
You will see the empty code chunk spaces where you can write your code.

Submission:

For this practical, ONLY code must be submitted. NO answer sheet. Submission can be done in one of two ways:

1. Use the html handout and write an R script to answer the questions. Your submission is then a .r script.
   Use the same principals as with previous practical script writing.
2. Fill in the R markdown code chunks on the handout .rmd file. Submit the .rmd file.

Tip with option 2: Make sure you can knit your file - a good way to ensure that all the code chunks run.

As always: Type your name and student number at the top and save the file containing your student number 
(Something like STUDENTNO_prac3)
