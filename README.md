UP (2018)
My repository for university assignments in R, SAS, SQL, Excel VBA, Latex and MATLAB.

PLEASE NOTE:
  Some of the files in this repository are memorandums to the projects that I have done and, as such, are not necessarily my own work. This repository is merely meant to be a backup of the programming experience I gained at the University of Pretoria and having lost some of my own work during my time there, the memorandums were added to fill the gaps. Some files may also be copyrighted and hence should not be copied/used in any infringing way.
