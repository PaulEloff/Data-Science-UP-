UP (2018)
My repository for university assignments in R, SAS, SQL, Excel VBA, Latex and MATLAB.

Please note that some of the files in this repository are memorandums to the projects that I have done and, as such, are not necessarily my own work. This repository is merely meant to be a backup of the programming experience I gained at the University of Pretoria and having lost some of my own work during my time there, the memorandums were added to fill the gaps.
