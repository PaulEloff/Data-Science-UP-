## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)#cars data sets in a dataset built into R
```


Notice how the output appears in this document as well as in the output window. 

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

1) Read through the document rmarkdown-2.0.df provided on ClickUp to get used to the editing options available in a .Rmd file like this one. 

2) Now we implement simulations for Chapter 14. 
(a) Generate 18 random numbers in the interval [0,1] using the linear congruential generator by completing the code below. 

```{r}
a <- 35
c <- 11
m <- 123
x_0 <- 13
x <- vector(length=18)

for (i in 1:18){
  x_0 <- (a*x_0+c)%%m
  x[i] <- x_0/m
}
x

```

(b) Generate observations from each of the following distributions using the random numbers in (a). Include your code and output of the generated values. Describe any difficulties encountered and how you dealt with them. 

i)  $X \sim \textrm{bin}(6,0.25)$
```{r}
qbinom(x,6,0.25)
```
ii)  $X \sim \textrm{Poisson}(2.8)$
```{r}
qpois(x,2.8)
```
iii)  $X \sim \textrm{Uni}(1,2,0.25)$ (discrete)
```{r}
qunif(x)
```
iv)  $X \sim \textrm{N}(5,1.1)$
```{r}
var <- 1.1^0.5
qnorm(x,5,var)
```
v)   $X \sim \textrm{logN}(\cdot,\cdot)$ with $E[X] = 5$ and $var(X)=1.1$
```{r}
qlnorm(x,5,var)
```
vi)  $X \sim \textrm{exp}(3.5)$
```{r}
qexp(x,3.5)
```
vii)  $X \sim \textrm{Gamma}(3,12)$
```{r}
qgamma(x,3,12)
```
viii)  $X \sim \textrm{Uni}(1,3)$ (continuous)
```{r}
qunif(x)
```
ix)  $X \sim \textrm{Pareto}(2.5,6)$
```{r}
qpareto(x,2.5,6)
```

(Note how the Latex code above displays for short time periods and when this .Rmd file is knitted the Latex equations will have been compiled. You may have to kniw twice to make the Latex code compile. )
